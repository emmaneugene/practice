# Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence

# Time complexity: O(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(n)
# Dynamic programming, starting from first character of first string and iteratively
# storing the longest subsequences that end with that character.  similar to longestIncrSubsequence
